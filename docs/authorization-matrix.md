# Authorization and tenant-isolation matrix

All bearer routes require a live session: anonymous, malformed, expired,
revoked, suspended, and deleted users receive `401` without resource data.
`ADMIN` is the only administrator role; `DEVELOPER`, `ISSUER`, and `WORKER`
have no implicit administrative access. A protected resource scoped to another
user or organization is answered as `404`, identical to an absent resource.

| Routes | Identity and permission | Ownership rule | Denial |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET/POST /auth/session,/logout,/rotate` | bearer session | own session | 401 |
| `GET/POST/PATCH /proofs`, `POST /proofs/*`, `PATCH /proofs/:id/revoke`, `GET /proofs/:id/verification-stats` | bearer session | proof owner | 401/404 |
| `GET /proofs/:id/verify`, `POST /credentials/verify` | public | only published verification result | no protected fields |
| `POST /payment-backfills`, `GET /payment-backfills/:id`, `POST /payment-backfills/:id/cancel` | bearer `ADMIN` | global admin exception | 401/403/404 |
| `GET/POST/PATCH /payments*`, `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /trusted-sources*` | bearer session | user-owned record | 401/404 |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /webhooks*`, delivery replay | bearer `DEVELOPER` or `ADMIN` | caller's organization | 401/403/404 |
| `GET /organizations`, `GET/PATCH /organizations/:id` | bearer | creator; ADMIN exception | 401/404 |
| `GET/PATCH /users/me` | bearer session | caller's own account only; identity from the session, never the path | 401/422 |
| `GET /users/:id`, `PATCH /users/:id/status`, `PATCH /users/:id/role` | bearer `ADMIN` | global admin; never the caller's own status or role | 401/403/404/409 |
| `POST /organizations`, issuer create/update/sync and `/issuers/admin*` | bearer `ADMIN` | global admin exception | 401/403 |
| `GET /issuers*` | public for published issuer data; bearer for admin views | published vs admin view | 401/403/404 |
| `GET/POST/DELETE /api-keys*`, rotate/revoke | bearer organization creator or ADMIN | organization-scoped query | 401/403/404 |
| `GET /integrations/auth-context` | API key + `ORG_READ` | key organization selected by `X-Organization-Id` | 401 invalid/cross-org, 403 scope |
| `GET /health/diagnostics` | API key + `ORG_ADMIN` | key organization | 401/403 |

Account status transitions are `PENDING→ACTIVE|SUSPENDED|REVOKED`,
`ACTIVE→SUSPENDED|REVOKED` and `SUSPENDED→ACTIVE|REVOKED`; `REVOKED` is
terminal and `DELETED` is never assigned through the API. Suspension and
revocation revoke every live session in the same transaction and refuse new
logins; reinstatement revokes again, so it never resurrects a session. An account that still owns a live organization (implicit ownership:
`Organization.createdById`) cannot be moved to `WORKER`.

The table-driven e2e suite verifies allowed and denied sessions, role denial,
cross-tenant indistinguishability, suspended/deleted users, and API-key scopes
without treating a bearer session as an API key. Audit and error envelopes must
contain only bounded identifiers and never credential secrets, wallet material,
payment records, or hidden resource fields.
