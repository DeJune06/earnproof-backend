/**
 * ProofExpirationReconcilerService
 *
 * Runs every 5 minutes. Finds proofs that have passed their expiresAt timestamp
 * but still have status=ACTIVE, and transitions them to status=EXPIRED.
 *
 * Design properties:
 *
 * **Idempotent.** The query filters on status=ACTIVE AND expiresAt <= NOW(),
 * so re-running the job on the same proof is a no-op. Safe under overlapping
 * executions or restarts.
 *
 * **Bounded.** Processes at most RECONCILE_BATCH_SIZE * MAX_BATCHES_PER_CYCLE
 * proofs per tick. Large backlogs drain over multiple cycles without locking
 * the database indefinitely.
 *
 * **Index-optimised.** Uses the existing @@index([expiresAt]) and
 * @@index([userId, status]) indexes from the Proof model. Queries are
 * efficient even with millions of proofs.
 *
 * **Revocation-aware.** A proof that was revoked before it expired remains
 * REVOKED. A proof that expires while revoked stays REVOKED. The job only
 * transitions ACTIVE → EXPIRED.
 *
 * **Eventually consistent.** Verification logic already computes expiration
 * at read time (expiresAt <= NOW()), so a proof that hasn't been reconciled
 * yet still behaves correctly. This job exists to improve query performance
 * and dashboard accuracy, not correctness.
 *
 * Configuration: Disabled by default. Enable via
 * PROOF_EXPIRATION_RECONCILIATION_ENABLED=true in .env.
 *
 * Secret safety: only proof IDs and counts appear in logs; no credential
 * hashes or user data are logged.
