/**
 * Bounded, resumable cleanup of expired operational records.
 *
 * Three properties shape the implementation:
 *
 * **Bounded.** Every pass deletes at most {@link BATCH_SIZE} rows, selected by
 * an indexed cutoff column. An unbounded `deleteMany` on a large table takes
 * locks for as long as it runs, which turns a routine sweep into a database
 * incident — exactly the failure the anchoring worker's batching already avoids.
 *
 * **Resumable.** Progress is the deletion itself. There is no cursor to persist:
 * a run that dies halfway leaves fewer eligible rows, and the next run continues
 * from wherever it stopped. This is what makes a crash mid-sweep uninteresting.
 *
 * **Coordinated.** An in-process guard prevents a slow run from overlapping the
 * next scheduled tick. Multi-instance coordination requires a shared lock and is
 * called out in `docs/data-retention.md` as a deliberate limitation rather than
 * left as an assumption.
 *
 * **Previewable.** A dry run walks exactly the pages a real run would delete —
 * same filter, same order, same page size, same batch cap — and writes nothing.
 * Both modes go through `selectPage`, so under a fixed clock and unchanged data
 * they select the same rows by construction, not by two query builders
 * happening to agree.
